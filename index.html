			<h1>Biography</h1>
			<p>
               <br><Br> Jasprit Bumrah grabbed eyeballs first with his unorthodox action, and then his bowling skills. Armed with an anomalous, sling-arm action and natural pace, the peculiar release point of Bumrah's deliveries makes it hard for batsmen to pick him.

<br><br>Besides, like his Mumbai Indians team-mate, Lasith Malinga, Bumrah carved himself a reputation for possessing an uncanny ability to hit the blockhole. And, it was during his time in the IPL that he learned from the Sri Lankan to judiciously use the yorker.

<br><br>A regular member of the India A team, Bumrah was on the fringes of national selection before a debilitating left knee injury at the end of 2014 kept him out for four-and-a-half months. He had to wait more than a year before earning another call-up, one which came on the back of a fruitful 2015-16 domestic season, where he was Gujarat's second-highest wicket-taker in the Ranji Trophy and topped the bowling charts in the Vijay Hazare Trophy - that included a five-for in the List-A final that gave Gujarat their maiden one-day title.

<br>Those performances, and an untimely injury to Mohammed Shami, meant Bumrah took the flight to Australia, where he played a central role for India, finishing as the highest wicket-taker from either side as the visitors swept the T20Is 3-0. It was a showing that earned him the praise of MS Dhoni - who called him the find of the tour - as well as a place in India's squad for the 2016 World T20.
